# Static typing with Flow

In my JavaScript applications, there are three layers of code "safety" that I like to add:

1. ESLint, to make sure the code follows a certain standard
2. Unit testing, to make sure the codes are testable
3. Static typing, to add clarity and reduce confusion

In this article, I'd like to discuss static typing using Flow.

## How-to

* Install the required libraries, run `npm install`
* Run the front-end development server, `npm run dev`
* Open the web app on `http://localhost:8000/`
