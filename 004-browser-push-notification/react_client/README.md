# amp-react-app

This is my minimal setup to start a React app. What it contains:

1. EcmaScript support
2. Modular CSS support
3. Simple Node server
4. Spread syntax
5. Stateless component support
6. ‘Rubik’ from Google Fonts

## How-to

* Install the required libraries, run `npm install`
* Run the front-end development server, `npm run dev`
* Open the web app on `http://localhost:8000/`

## Updating the libraries

Use `npx npm-check-updates` -u and `npm install` to upgrade all dependencies to their latest major versions.
